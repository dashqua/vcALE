Many diverse multiphysics applications can be reduced, en route to their computational simulation, to a common algebraic coupling paradigm. Mathematical analysis of multiphysics coupling in this form is not always practical for realistic applications, but model problems representative of applications discussed herein can provide insight. A variety of software frameworks for multiphysics applications have been constructed and refined within disciplinary communities and executed on leading-edge computer systems. We examine several of these, expose some commonalities among them, and attempt to extrapolate best practices to future systems. From our study, we summarize challenges and forecast opportunities. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

The stabilized space-time FSI (SSTFSI) technique serves as a robust and accurate core FSI method, and a number of special FSI methods address the computational challenges specific to spacecraft parachutes. Some spacecraft FSI problems involve even more specific computational challenges and require additional special methods. An example of that is the impulse ejection and parachute extraction of a protective cover used in a spacecraft. The computational challenges specific to this problem are related to the sudden changes in the parachute loads and sudden separation of the cover with very little initial clearance from the spacecraft. We describe the core and special FSI methods, and present the methods we use in FSI analysis of the parachute dynamics and cover separation, including the temporal NURBS representation in modeling the separation motion. {\textcopyright} 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract = {Since its introduction in 1991 for computation of flow problems with moving boundaries and interfaces, the Deforming-Spatial-Domain/Stabilized SpaceTime (DSD/SST) formulation has been applied to a diverse set of challenging problems. The classes of problems computed include free-surface and two-fluid flows, fluidobject, fluidparticle and fluidstructure interaction (FSI), and flows with mechanical components in fast, linear or rotational relative motion. The DSD/SST formulation, as a core technology, is being used for some of the most challenging FSI problems, including parachute modeling and arterial FSI. Versions of the DSD/SST formulation introduced in recent years serve as lower-cost alternatives. More recent variational multiscale (VMS) version, which is called DSD/SST-VMST (and also ST-VMS), has brought better computational accuracy and serves as a reliable turbulence model. Special spacetime FSI techniques introduced for specific classes of problems, such as parachute modeling and arterial FSI, have increased the scope and accuracy of the FSI modeling in those classes of computations. This paper provides an overview of the core spacetime FSI technique, its recent versions, and the special spacetime FSI techniques. The paper includes test computations with the DSD/SST-VMST technique. {\textcopyright} 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

@article{Hartmann2003,
abstract = {In this article we investigate several models contained in the literature in the case of near-incompressibility based on invariants in terms of polyconvexity and coerciveness inequality, which are sufficient to guarantee the existence of a solution. These models are due to Rivlin and Saunders, namely the generalized polynomial-type elasticity, and Arruda and Boyce. The extension to near-incompressibility is usually carried out by an additive decomposition of the strain energy into a volume-changing and a volume-preserving part, where the volume-changing part depends on the determinant of the deformation gradient and the volume-preserving part on the invariants of the unimodular right Cauchy-Green tensor. It will be shown that the Arruda-Boyce model satisfies the polyconvexity condition, whereas the polynomial-type elasticity does not. Therefore, we propose a new class of strain-energy functions depending on invariants. Moreover, we focus our attention on the structure of further isotropic strain-energy functions. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A mixed formulation based upon the use of the linear momentum, the deformation gradient tensor and the total energy as conservation variables is discretised in space using linear triangles and tetrahedra in two-dimensional and three-dimensional computations, respectively. The scheme is implemented using central differences for the evaluation of the interface fluxes in conjunction with the Jameson-Schmidt-Turkel (JST) artificial dissipation term. The discretisation in time is performed by using a Total Variational Diminishing (TVD) two-stage Runge-Kutta time integrator. The JST algorithm is adapted in order to ensure the preservation of linear and angular momenta. The framework results in a low order computationally efficient solver for solid dynamics, which proves to be very competitive in nearly incompressible scenarios and bending dominated applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to investigate jump conditions for unsteady small perturbations at impermeable interfaces, slip or bonded, plane or not, between fluids and structures in the presence of initial flow and prestress. Based on conservative equations obtained from a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian description, interface conditions are first derived in an elegant and straightforward manner thanks to the concept of generalized functions in distribution theory. These conditions are validated with exact conditions derived from a direct linearization of the standard jump conditions. For a straightforward comparison between both approaches, all conditions are written in terms of a curvilinear coordinate system attached to the interface. The normal Lagrangian displacement continuity across the interface is proved to be a sufficient condition. The jump conditions for mass, momentum, energy and entropy are discussed, yielding conditions for the Lagrangian perturbations of displacement, stress, heat flux and temperature. Displacement and stress jump conditions are shown to coincide with literature results. The mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian description is likely to be advantageous over its fully Eulerian or Lagrangian counterparts. It yields an interesting unification between existing formulations for inviscid fluids (Galbrun's equation) and solids (updated Lagrangian formulation), together with simpler jump conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Design of fuel tanks requires the knowledge of hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the structure. These can be very useful for engineers and designers to define appropriate material properties and shell thickness of the structure to be resistant under sloshing or hydrodynamic loading. Data presented in current tank design codes as Eurocode, are based on simplified assumptions for the geometry and material tank properties. For complex material data and complex tank geometry, numerical simulations need to performed in order to reduce experimental tests that are costly and take longer time to setup. Different formulations have been used for sloshing tank analysis, including ALE (Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian) and SPH (Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic). The ALE formulation uses a moving mesh with a mesh velocity defined trough the structure motion. In this paper the mathematical and numerical implementation of the FEM and SPH formulations for sloshing problem are described. From different simulations, it has been observed that for the SPH method to provide similar results as ALE formulation, the SPH meshing, or SPH particle spacing needs to be finer than ALE mesh. To validate the statement, we perform a simulation of a sloshing analysis inside a partially filled tank. For this simple, the particle spacing of SPH method needs to be at least two times finer than ALE mesh. A contact algorithm is performed at the fluid structure interface and SPH particles. In the paper the efficiency and usefulness of two methods, often used in numerical simulations, are compared.},

Dynamic mesh handling includes deforming mesh cases, where the number and connectivity of mesh elements remains unchanged; and topological changes, where mesh size and connectivity varies during the simulation. Cases where the boundary deformation itself represents a part of the solution demand special attention: here, mesh handling needs to be fully automatic. This paper describes dynamic mesh support in OpenFOAM, a C++ object-oriented library for numerical simulations in continuum mechanics. Unlike other tools, where dynamic mesh support is usually retro-fitted, object-oriented dynamic mesh engine has been built up from ground-up. Emphasis is given polyhedral cell support in mesh analysis and discretisation, vertex-based automatic mesh motion techniques and hierarchical design of topology morphing engine.

abstract = {A vertex centred Jameson-Schmidt-Turkel (JST) finite volume algorithm was recently introduced by the authors (Aguirre et al., 2014 [1]) in the context of fast solid isothermal dynamics. The spatial discretisation scheme was constructed upon a Lagrangian two-field mixed (linear momentum and the deformation gradient) formulation presented as a system of conservation laws [2-4]. In this paper, the formulation is further enhanced by introducing a novel upwind vertex centred finite volume algorithm with three key novelties. First, a conservation law for the volume map is incorporated into the existing two-field system to extend the range of applications towards the incompressibility limit (Gil et al., 2014 [5]). Second, the use of a linearised Riemann solver and reconstruction limiters is derived for the stabilisation of the scheme together with an efficient edge-based implementation. Third, the treatment of thermo-mechanical processes through a Mie-Gr{\"{u}}neisen equation of state is incorporated in the proposed formulation. For completeness, the study of the eigenvalue structure of the resulting system of conservation laws is carried out to demonstrate hyperbolicity and obtain the correct time step bounds for non-isothermal processes. A series of numerical examples are presented in order to assess the robustness of the proposed methodology. The overall scheme shows excellent behaviour in shock and bending dominated nearly incompressible scenarios without spurious pressure oscillations, yielding second order of convergence for both velocities and stresses.},

High-resolution versions of Godunov's method are developed, in which Riemann problems are solved to determine the local wave structure and limiters are then applied to eliminate numerical oscillations. These methods were originally designed to capture shock waves accurately, but are also useful tools for studying linear wave-propagation problems, particularly in heterogenous material. The methods studied are implemented in the CLAWPACK software package and source code for all the examples presented can be found on the web, along with animations of many of the simulations.

abstract = {This paper presents a novel computational formulation for large strain polyconvex elasticity. The formulation, based on the original ideas introduced by Schr{\"{o}}der etal. (2011), introduces the deformation gradient (the fibre map), its adjoint (the area map) and its determinant (the volume map) as independent kinematic variables of a convex strain energy function. Compatibility relationships between these variables and the deformed geometry are enforced by means of a multi-field variational principle with additional constraints. This process allows the use of different approximation spaces for each variable. The paper extends the ideas presented in Schr{\"{o}}der etal. (2011) by introducing conjugate stresses to these kinematic variables which can be used to define a generalised convex complementary energy function and a corresponding complementary energy principle of the Hellinger-Reissner type, where the new conjugate stresses are primary variables together with the deformed geometry. Both compressible and incompressible or nearly incompressible elastic models are considered. A key element to the developments presented in the paper is the new use of a tensor cross product, presented for the first time by de Boer (1982), page 76, which facilitates the algebra associated with the adjoint of the deformation gradient. For the numerical examples, quadratic interpolation of the displacements, piecewise linear interpolation of strain and stress fields and piecewise constant interpolation of the Jacobian and its stress conjugate are considered for compressible cases. In the case of incompressible materials two formulations are presented. First, continuous quadratic interpolation for the displacement together with piecewise constant interpolation for the pressure and second, linear continuous interpolation for both displacement and pressure stabilised via a Petrov-Galerkin technique.},

The key idea lies at the approximation level, where a nonlinear adaptive procedure is used to automatically choose the locally smoothest stencil, hence avoiding crossing discontinuities in the interpolation procedure as much as possible. ENO and WENO schemes have been quite successful in applications, especially for problems containing both shocks and complicated smooth solution structures, such as compressible turbulence simulations and aeroacoustics. These lecture notes are basically self-contained. It is our hope that with these notes and with the help of the quoted references, the reader can understand the algorithms and code them up for applications. Sample codes are also available from the author.},

abstract = {A finite element method is used for computing the non-linear sloshing response of liquid in a two-dimensional rigid rectangular tank with rigid baffles. The potential formulation is considered for the liquid domain and a mixed Eulerian-Langrangian scheme is adopted. The solution is obtained by the Galerkin method. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is employed to advance the solution in the time domain. A regridding technique is applied to the free surface of the liquid, which effectively eliminates the numerical instabilities without the use of artificial smoothing. Through the comparison with the available results for the rectangular tank without baffle, the validity of the present formulation is checked and then extended to the solution of tanks with rigid baffles. The effects of baffle parameters such as position, dimension and numbers on the non-linear sloshing response are examined. The present numerical solution procedure is also applied to the non-linear sloshing problems in a circular cylindrical container with annular baffle.

abstract = {As explosive blasts continue to cause casualties in both civil and military environments, there is a need to identify the dynamic interaction of blast loading with structures, to know the shock mitigating mechanisms and, most importantly, to identify the mechanisms of blast trauma. This paper examines the air-blast simulation using Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) multi-material formulation. It will explain how the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) can be simulated using a coupling algorithm for the treatment of the fluid as a moving media by a moving mesh using ALE formulation and how the structure is treated on a deformable mesh using a Lagrangian formulation. To validate the numerical approach, as well as to prove its ability to simulate complicated scenarios, comparison of three distinct blast scenarios, i.e., blast from C-4 and TNT in open space and blast on a circular steel plate, with the experimental data was performed. The predicted numerical results match very well with those of experiments. This computational approach is able to accurately predict the relevant aspects of the blast-structure interaction problem, including the blast wave propagation in the medium and the response of the structure to blast loading. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The Riemann solutions preserve the characteristic structure of the underlying elastodynamic system and imply dynamic contact conditions that are distinct from the quasi-static conditions used in some numerical models. Nonphysical discontinuities in the standard Coulomb model at stick-slip transitions can cause contact-mode chatter in numerical simulations. We restate the Coulomb relation to remove these artificial discontinuities and eliminate the need for algorithmic remedies. Discontinuous response at abrupt separation-to-contact transitions is physically reasonable, and we propose a regularization scheme to address this case.

abstract = {NHS braced for worst of Alistair Darling's {\pounds}5bn spending cuts Published: 27 November 2008 09:00 Author: Sally Gainsbury More by this Author Last Updated: 27 November 2008 10:01 Reader Responses The Treasury believes there are savings to be made with the NHS budget The Treasury believes there are savings to be made with the NHS budget Increase image View all images The NHS must prepare for a substantial cut in planned funding from the year after next. Chancellor Alistair Darling's pre-Budget report set out plans to cut {\pounds}5bn from government spending plans for 2010-11 - and the NHS is the largest of 12 areas that could be hit. In the past, some efficiency savings have been delivered through productivity gains - doing more for the same money - rather than through resources being cut. But the Treasury describes the {\pounds}5bn as "recoverable savings" and removes any doubt as to whether these will involve cuts to funding allocations by clearly subtracting {\pounds}5bn from its latest table of departmental revenue allocations for 2010-11. "I suspect people will have their allocations reduced and told that now they are 'world class' they will have to get on with it" The {\pounds}70bn NHS commissioning budget is cited as an area in which the Treasury believes savings could be made. It explicitly links efficiency savings with the world class commissioning programme, which the Department of Health has previously stressed is all about quality improvement. It says: "As primary care trusts enhance their commissioning skills towards world class standards over the next years they will unlock cashable value-for-money improvements across the {\pounds}70bn of commissioned health services." Value for money The precise "value for money impact" of the world class commissioning programme will be set out in the Budget next year, as will the "scope to increase efficiency further" through the hospital tariff. Alan Downey, head of healthcare at consultants KPMG, said: "This is new. The focus up to now has been on the 11 world class commissioning competencies... There has been no focus on cost savings as the aim of the exercise." NHS Confederation policy director Nigel Edwards said: "I suspect people will have their allocations reduced and told that now they are 'world class' they will have to get on with it." But DH director general of commissioning and system management Mark Britnell told HSJ: "This is a great opportunity for world class commissioning to demonstrate that PCTs can make sound financial investments and meet government efficiency targets." The report says the Treasury's public value programme has identified {\pounds}100m a year that could be saved from 2010-11 by improving use of the NHS estate to "reduce the need for new hospital space". It also paves the way for entire PCT property estates to be transferred to public-private partnerships, to be known as PropCos. The 2009-10 operating framework will contain more details of the plans. Budget cuts The details of the cuts to each of the 12 government spending areas will be set out in the Budget. The approximate total value of government spending that will be prime targets for cuts is {\pounds}250bn, of which {\pounds}5bn is 2 per cent. A 2 per cent cut to the NHS budget would be {\pounds}2.1bn. If the savings were shared between government departments according to the same proportion as previous year's efficiency targets, the DH's cut would be nearer {\pounds}1.35bn. Mr Edwards said there was a danger that the NHS's share of the {\pounds}5bn cut would be passed on to acute providers through reductions in tariff prices and contracts. "That would not be efficiency," he said, adding that PCTs must "urgently" look to make savings by using cheaper procedures and treatments. An extra {\pounds}100m in capital funds will be spent upgrading up to 600 GP practices to "training practices" as part of Mr Darling's {\pounds}3bn attempt to stimulate the economy by bringing forward planned investment. Last year's comprehensive spending review pledged to increase public sector spending in real terms by an average of 1.9 per cent a year between 2008-09 and 2010-11. But the pre-Budget report says spending will grow by just 1.2 per cent in real terms between 2011-12 and 2013-14. A DH spokesman said the NHS was well placed for the challenges ahead. "The NHS has a good track record," he said. THE REPORT IN NUMBERS {\pounds}5bn The total reduction to planned public spending in 2010-11. {\pounds}1.35bn- {\pounds}2.5bn The NHS's likely share of the reduction. {\pounds}32.7bn Total value of the non-hospital trust NHS estate, part of which could be transferred to public- private partnerships. {\pounds}100m Savings the Treasury expects the NHS to make per year by cutting hospital space. KEY POINTS NHS budget one of 12 areas of public spending highlighted as a target for a share of {\pounds}5bn of cuts to planned spending in 2010-11 Commissioning cited as area in which savings could be made and world class commissioning will be assessed in next year's Budget for the impact it will have on value for money LIFT scheme to be expanded, with DH due to announce plans for PCTs to transfer entire estates to public private partnership schemes {\pounds}100m of planned capital spending brought forward from 2010-11 to 2009-10 to upgrade 600 GP practices into training practices as part of the Treasury's {\pounds}3bn "fiscal stimulus" {\pounds}1.1bn net cut from planned capital spending between 2009 and 2011.

The method is motivated by the cracking-particle method (Rabczuk T., Belytschko T., International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 2004) where the crack is modeled by a set of cracked segments. However, in contrast to the above mentioned paper, we do not introduce additional unknowns in the variational formulation to capture the displacement discontinuity. Instead, the crack is modeled by splitting particles located on opposite sides of the associated crack segments and we make use of the visibility method in order to describe the crack kinematics. We apply this method to several two- and three-dimensional problems in statics and dynamics and show through several numerical examples that the method does not show any "mesh" orientation bias. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

It is also shown that no scheme whose interface flux derives from a linearised Riemann solution can be positively conservative. Classes of data that will bring about the failure of such schemes are described. However, the Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLLE) scheme is positively conservative under certain conditions on the numerical wavespeeds, and this observation allows the linearised schemes to be rescued by modifying the wavespeeds employed. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {The effect of the Knudsen layer in the thermal micro-scale gas flows has been investigated. The effective mean free path model has been implemented in the open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, to extend its applicability up to slip and early transition flow regime. The conventional Navier-Stokes constitutive relations and the first-order non-equilibrium boundary conditions are modified based on the effective mean free path, which depends on the distance from the solid surface. The predictive capability of the standard 'Maxwell velocity slip-Smoluchwoski temperature jump' and hybrid boundary conditions 'Langmuir Maxwell velocity slip-Langmuir Smoluchwoski temperature jump' in conjunction with the Knudsen layer formulation has been evaluated in the present work. Simulations are carried out over a nano-/micro-scale backward facing step geometry in which flow experiences adverse pressure gradient, separation and re-attachment. Results are validated against the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) data, and have shown significant improvement over the existing CFD solvers. Non-equilibrium effects on the velocity and temperature of gas on the surface of the backward facing step channel are studied by varying the flow Knudsen number, inlet flow temperature, and wall temperature. Results show that the modified solver with hybrid Langmuir based boundary conditions gives the best predictions when the Knudsen layer is incorporated, and the standard Maxwell-Smoluchowski can accurately capture momentum and the thermal Knudsen layer when the temperature of the wall is higher than the fluid flow.},

abstract = {The dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration that induces the onset of anaerobic metabolism in hard clams was found to be 1.11mgO 2L -1, at which time, the concentration of succinate in the body fluid was 4.4$\mu$molmL -1. When the DO concentration was {\textless}1.11mgO 2L -1, the burial depth was significantly reduced, and succinate significantly accumulated in the body fluid. After 24h of anoxic exposure, succinate had accumulated in the gills and equal amounts of succinate and alanine had accumulated in the foot. This indicates that carbohydrates in the gills and amino acids in the foot contribute to anaerobic energy production. The accumulation rates of succinate and propionate in the body fluid were the highest compared with those in other tissues, while no accumulation of alanine in the body fluid was found. The recovery rates of succinate in the body fluid and alanine in the foot were the highest compared with those in other tissues. The results of this study suggest that the DO concentration in the bottom water of clam ponds should be maintained at ≥1.11mgO 2L -1, and the anoxia-tolerant ability of hard clams can be assessed by the contents of carbohydrates. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {This document is part of the project Tools for Large Scale Computational Fluid Dynamics, LSCFD. The project is managed by CSC-IT Center for Science Ltd. (CSC) and partially funded by Tekes (Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation). The main objective of the project is to promote the use of large scale CFD in Finland. The project will support, enhance and document the use of selected open source CFD solvers. Mesh generation is an essential part of the solution procedure which often consumes the most of the human resources. In this report three different tools or utilities for creating a computational mesh for OpenFOAM CFD code are presented: SALOME, gmsh and OpenFOAM snappyHexMesh. All these software are open source. The point of view of this study is on practical side, i.e. usability, software ergonomics and ability to produce high quality mesh are emphasised instead of meshing algorithms. The same study and test procedure has been applied for all three tools. Software functionality is studied based on software manuals and by using the software. One common, industrial meshing test case was selected. With this test case the usability of these tools could be tested into some extend and compared. In the last section there is presented some comments about these tools and in general about the development of open source mesh generation tools. A typical pre-processing (mesh generation) process for CFD or FEM computation is described in general. In this process description the domain geometry is taken as is from the design system (typically CAD system) and all the modifications are done during the pre-processing process. The study indicates that there are good open source software components already available for CFD pre-processing, but at least the tested implementations haven't been completely successful in using them and implementing a really user friendly, intuitive and industrial strength pre-processing tool. None of the tested tools or methods can be recommended for general industrial use as such. More development needs to be done for these meshing tools to reach a level where the whole process is efficient and produces high quality results. But the development seems to be on right path and all the elements for good progress are already available.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new fluid-structure interaction immersed computational methodology, based upon the original Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) [1] is outlined with the final aim of modelling cardiovascular phenomena, specifically, heart valve related problems. The principal characteristic of such immersed techniques is the representation of any deformable or rigid body immersed within an incompressible viscous flow field as a momentum forcing source in the Navier-Stokes equations. A number of shortcomings within the immersed formulation still require further investigation and improvement, including the excessive numerical diffusion caused by the interpolation/spreading process, the need to include realistic viscoelastic composite constitutive models describing more accurately the nature of cardiovascular tissues and also the need to capture more effectively stresses developed at the fluid-structure interface. By following the same philosophy as the original IBM, a more sophisticated formulation is derived in this paper, the "Immersed Structural Potential Method (ISPM)" The method introduced presents an alternative approach to compute the equivalent fluid-structure interaction forces at the fluid mesh, accounts for a sophisticated viscoelastic fibre-reinforced constitutive model to better describe the mechanics of cardiovascular tissues and utilises a novel time-integration methodology for the computation of the deformation gradient tensor which ensures compliance with the incompressibility constraint. A series of numerical examples will be presented in order to demonstrate the robustness and applicability of this new methodology. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We describe a method for computing time-dependent solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations on variable geometries. We introduce a continuous mapping between a fixed reference configuration and the time-varying domain. By writing the Navier-Stokes equations as a conservation law for the independent variables in the reference configuration, the complexity introduced by variable geometry is reduced to solving a transformed conservation law in a fixed reference configuration. The spatial discretization is carried out using the Discontinuous Galerkin method on unstructured meshes of triangles, while the time integration is performed using an explicit Runge-Kutta method. For general domain changes, the standard scheme fails to preserve exactly the free-stream solution which leads to some accuracy degradation, especially for low order approximations. This situation is remedied by adding an additional equation for the time evolution of the transformation Jacobian to the original conservation law and correcting for the accumulated metric integration errors. A number of results are shown to illustrate the flexibility of the approach to handle high-order approximations on complex geometries. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Dynamic mesh handling includes deforming mesh cases, where the number and connectivity of mesh elements remains unchanged; and topological changes, where mesh size and connectivity varies during the simulation. Cases where the boundary deformation itself represents a part of the solution demand special attention: here, mesh handling needs to be fully automatic. This paper describes dynamic mesh support in OpenFOAM, a C++ object-oriented library for numerical simulations in continuum mechanics. Unlike other tools, where dynamic mesh support is usually retro-fitted, object-oriented dynamic mesh engine has been built up from ground-up. Emphasis is given polyhedral cell support in mesh analysis and discretisation, vertex-based automatic mesh motion techniques and hierarchical design of topology morphing engine. The paper is completed with examples of solution-dependent motion with large boundary deformation. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.},

abstract = {Longitudinal data tracking repeated measurements on individuals are highly valued for research because they offer controls for unmeasured individual heterogeneity that might otherwise bias results. Random effects or mixed models approaches, which treat individual heterogeneity as part of the model error term and use generalized least squares to estimate model parameters, are often criticized because correlation between unobserved individual effects and other model variables can lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates. Starting with an examination of the relationship between random effects and fixed effects estimators in the standard unobserved effects model, this article demonstrates through analysis and simulation that the mixed model approach has a “bias compression” prop- erty under a general model for individual heterogeneity that can mitigate bias due to uncontrolled differences among individuals. The general model is motivated by the complexities of longitudinal student achievement measures, but the results have broad applicability to longitudinal modeling. {\textcopyright} 2007, Ashdin Publishing.

abstract = {The power of OpenFOAM in physical modelling stems from mimicking of partial differential equations in software, thus allowing rapid and reliable implementation of complex physical models. State-of-the art complex geometry handling and dynamic mesh features are essential for practical engineering use. This paper describes features of dynamic mesh support in OpenFOAM. Polyhedral mesh handling implemented in OpenFOAM is a flexible basis for its dynamic mesh features, at several levels. For simple cases of linear deformation or solid body mo- tion, algebraic expressions suffice. For complex cases of time-varying geometry [2] or solution dependent motion, mesh deformation is obtained by solving a mesh motion equa- tion. For extreme deformation, automatic motion is combined with topological changes, where the number or points, faces or cells in the mesh or its connectivity changes dur- ing the simulation. Finally, in cases of extreme and arbitrary mesh motion tetrahedral re-meshing based on edge swapping may be used. Examples of dynamic mesh handling with progressively complex requirements shall be used to show how object-oriented programming simplifies the use of dynamic mesh features with various physics solvers. A self-contained Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) solver in OpenFOAM acts as an illustration of dynamic meshing features and parallelised surface data transfer tools. It combines a second-order Finite Volume fluid flow solver with moving mesh support coupled to a large deformation formulation of the structural mechanics equations in an updated Lagrangian form [3].},

abstract = {The arbitrary Langrangian-Eulerian (ALE) description in non-linear solid mechanics is nowadays standard for hypoelastic-plastic models. An extension to hyperelastic-plastic models is presented here. A fractional-step method-a common choice in ALE analysis-is employed for time-marching: every time-step is split into a Lagrangian phase, which accounts for material effects, and a convection phase, where the relative motion between the material and the finite element mesh is considered. In contrast to previous ALE formulations of hyperelasticity or hyperelastoplasticity, the deformed configuration at the beginning of the time-step, not the initial undeformed configuration, is chosen as the reference configuration. As a consequence, convecting variables are required in the description of the elastic response. This is not the case in previous formulations, where only the plastic response contains convection terms. In exchange for the extra convective terms, however, the proposed ALE approach has a major advantage: only the quality of the mesh in the spatial domain must be ensured by the ALE remeshing strategy; in previous formulations, it is also necessary to keep the distortion of the mesh in the material domain under control. Thus, the full potential of the ALE description as an adaptive technique can be exploited here. These aspects are illustrated in detail by means of three numerical examples: a necking test, a coining test and a powder compaction test. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

The consistent added matrices of these weak coupling methods are derived from the condensation of the strong coupling formulation. Some approximations for the consistent added matrices, which can avoid the matrix coupling, are proposed. The reasons for convergence difficulty in the weak coupling methods are clarified.

Applications are discussed in °uid dynamics, nonlinear solid mechanics and coupled problems describing °uid-structure interaction. The need for an adequate mesh update strategy is underlined and various automatic mesh displacement prescription algorithms are reviewed. This includes mesh regularization methods essentially based on geometrical concepts, as well as mesh adaptation techniques aiming at optimizing the computational mesh according to some error indicator. Emphasis is then placed on particular issues related to the modeling of compressible and incompressible °ow and nonlinear solid mechanics problems. This includes the treatment of convective terms in the conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy, as well as a discussion of stress update procedures for materials with history-dependent constitutive behaviour.},

We also showed that implementing different boundary conditions (slip, no-slip) is straight-forward. The results obtained in such calculations only deviated by a few percent from the (exact) analytical solution. In this paper we demonstrate that these approaches extend to cases where time-dependency is of importance, e.g., during initiation or after removal of the driving pressure. As will be shown, the developed spread-sheet can be used conveniently for almost any cross-section for which analytical solutions are close-to-impossible to obtain. We believe that providing researchers with convenient tools to derive solutions to complex flow problems in a fast and intuitive way will significantly enhance the understanding of the flow conditions as well as mass and heat transfer kinetics in microfluidic systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel second-order accurate Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) finite volume scheme on moving nonconforming polygonal grids, in order to avoid the typical mesh distortion caused by shear flows in Lagrangian-type methods. In our new approach the nonconforming element interfaces are not defined by the user, but they are automatically detected by the algorithm if the tangential velocity difference across an element interface is sufficiently large. The grid nodes that are sufficiently far away from a shear wave are moved with a standard node solver, while at the interface we insert a new set of nodes that can slide in a nonconforming manner. In this way, the elements on both sides of the shear wave can move with a different velocity, without producing highly distorted elements. The core of the proposed method is the use of a space-time conservation formulation in the construction of the final finite volume scheme, which completely avoids the need of an additional remapping stage and ensures that the geometric conservation law (GCL) is automatically satisfied. Moreover, the mesh quality remains high and, as a direct consequence, also the time step remains almost constant in time, even for highly sheared vortex flows. The accuracy of the new scheme has been further improved by incorporating a special well balancing technique that is able to maintain particular stationary solutions of the governing PDE system up to machine precision. A large set of numerical tests has been carried out in order to check the accuracy and the robustness of the new method. In particular we have compared the results for a steady vortex in equilibrium solved with a standard conforming ALE method and with our new nonconforming ALE scheme, to show that the new nonconforming scheme is able to avoid mesh distortion even after very long simulation times.},

abstract = {The sloshing effects of an internal fluid on the flutter envelope of an aeroelastic system have received little attention in the open literature. This issue is nevertheless relevant for many aircraft, especially high-performance fighter jets carrying stores. This paper addresses some aspects of this problem as well as related modeling and analysis issues. These include the importance or insignificance of accounting for the hydroelastic effect when modeling an internal fluid and its container as well as accounting for that container when modeling the aerodynamics of the overall aeroelastic system. The paper also reports on the findings of four independent sets of flutter analyses performed for a wing-store test configuration and various fuel fill levels in the subsonic, transonic, and early supersonic regimes. Two of these sets of numerica l experiments relied on a computational-fluid-dynamics-based computational technology, and two of them on the doublet-lattice method or a supersonic lifting-surface theory, where applicable. The geometry of the chosen test configuration is that of the AGARD Wing 445.6 with a blunt-nosed store. The obtained computational results show that, at least for the considered wing-store configuration, ignoring the aforementioned hydroelastic effect tends to overestimate the added-mass effect and underestimate the critical pressure and flutter speed. They also reveal that, whereas the aerodynamics of the store may be neglected in the subsonic regime, they cannot be ignored in supersonic air streams. Finally, the performed computational study suggests that, in general, the critical pressure and flutter speed decrease with an increasing fuel fill level.

Firstly, basic simulations were performed using the proposed CFD method and turbulence model, which provides good prediction of the airfoil force coefficients and flutter derivatives compared with the well-known experimental measurement and analytical formulation. Then, extended airfoil flow simulations were carried out to examine the potentially significant effects on aeroelasticity from several influencing factors, including non-zero equilibrium angles of attack, increased forced vibration amplitudes and large Reynolds number.

abstract = {This paper introduces a new computational framework for the analysis of large strain fast solid dynamics. The paper builds upon previous work published by the authors (Gil etal., 2014) [48], where a first order system of hyperbolic equations is introduced for the simulation of isothermal elastic materials in terms of the linear momentum, the deformation gradient and its Jacobian as unknown variables. In this work, the formulation is further enhanced with four key novelties. First, the use of a new geometric conservation law for the co-factor of the deformation leads to an enhanced mixed formulation, advantageous in those scenarios where the co-factor plays a dominant role. Second, the use of polyconvex strain energy functionals enables the definition of generalised convex entropy functions and associated entropy fluxes for solid dynamics problems. Moreover, the introduction of suitable conjugate entropy variables enables the derivation of a symmetric system of hyperbolic equations, dual of that expressed in terms of conservation variables. Third, the new use of a tensor cross product [61] greatly facilitates the algebraic manipulations of expressions involving the co-factor of the deformation. Fourth, the development of a stabilised Petrov-Galerkin framework is presented for both systems of hyperbolic equations, that is, when expressed in terms of either conservation or entropy variables. As an example, a polyconvex Mooney-Rivlin material is used and, for completeness, the eigen-structure of the resulting system of equations is studied to guarantee the existence of real wave speeds. Finally, a series of numerical examples is presented in order to assess the robustness and accuracy of the new mixed methodology, benchmarking it against an ample spectrum of alternative numerical strategies, including implicit multi-field Fraeijs de Veubeke-Hu-Washizu variational type approaches and explicit cell and vertex centred Finite Volume schemes.},

@article{Hirsch2007,
abstract = {This chapter elaborates finite volume method (FVM) and conservative discretization with an introduction to finite element method (FEM). The FVM is the name given to the technique by which the integral formulation of the conservation laws is discretized directly in the physical space. Once a grid has been generated, the FVM consists in associating a local finite volume, also called control volume, to each mesh point and applying the integral conservation law to this local volume. This is a first major distinction from the finite difference approach, where the discretized space is considered as a set of points, while in the FVM the discretized space is formed by a set of small cells, one cell being associated to one mesh point. Flow equations are the expression of a conservation law. The essential property has to be satisfied by the numerical discretization of the flux contributions in order for a scheme to be conservative. Numerical experiments and comparisons consistently show that nonconservative formulations are generally less accurate than conservative ones, particularly in the presence of strong gradients. The FEM definition of interpolation functions is also analyzed.},

@article{Kurganov2000,
abstract = {Central schemes may serve as universal finite-difference methods for solving nonlinear convection-diffusion equations in the sense that they are not tied to the specific eigenstructure of the problem, and hence can be implemented in a straightforward manner as black-box solvers for general conservation laws and related equations governing the spontaneous evolution of large gradient phenomena. The first-order Lax-Friedrichs scheme (P. D. Lax, 1954) is the forerunner for such central schemes. The central Nessyahu-Tadmor (NT) scheme (H. Nessyahu and E. Tadmor, 1990) offers higher resolution while retaining the simplicity of the Riemann-solver-free approach. The numerical viscosity present in these central schemes is of order O(($\Delta$x)2r/$\Delta$t). In the convective regime where $\Delta$t{\~{}}$\Delta$x, the improved resolution of the NT scheme and its generalizations is achieved by lowering the amount of numerical viscosity with increasing r. At the same time, this family of central schemes suffers from excessive numerical viscosity when a sufficiently small time step is enforced, e.g., due to the presence of degenerate diffusion terms. In this paper we introduce a new family of central schemes which retain the simplicity of being independent of the eigenstructure of the problem, yet which enjoy a much smaller numerical viscosity (of the corresponding order O($\Delta$x)2r-1)). In particular, our new central schemes maintain their high-resolution independent of O(1/$\Delta$t), and letting $\Delta$t ↓ 0, they admit a particularly simple semi-discrete formulation. The main idea behind the construction of these central schemes is the use of more precise information of the local propagation speeds. Beyond these CFL related speeds, no characteristic information is required. As a second ingredient in their construction, these central schemes realize the (nonsmooth part of the) approximate solution in terms of its cell averages integrated over the Riemann fans of varying size. The semi-discrete central scheme is then extended to multidimensional problems, with or without degenerate diffusive terms. Fully discrete versions are obtained with Runge-Kutta solvers. We prove that a scalar version of our high-resolution central scheme is nonoscillatory in the sense of satisfying the total-variation diminishing property in the one-dimensional case and the maximum principle in two-space dimensions. We conclude with a series of numerical examples, considering convex and nonconvex problems with and without degenerate diffusion, and scalar and systems of equations in one- and two-space dimensions. Time evolution is carried out by the third- and fourth-order explicit embedded integration Runge-Kutta methods recently proposed by A. Medovikov (1998). These numerical studies demonstrate the remarkable resolution of our new family of central scheme. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Results of an extensive comparison of numerical methods for simulating hydrodynamics are presented and discussed. This study focuses on the simulation of fluid flows with strong shocks in two dimensions. By "strong shocks," we here refer to shocks in which there is substantial entropy production. For the case of shocks in air, we therefore refer to Mach numbers of three and greater. For flows containing such strong shocks we find that a careful treatment of flow discontinuities is of greatest importance in obtaining accurate numerical results. Three approaches to treating discontinuities in the flow are discussed-artificial viscosity, blending of low- and high-order-accurate fluxes, and the use of nonlinear solutions to Riemann's problem. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are discussed and illustrated by computed results for three test problems. In this comparison we have focused our attention entirely upon the performance of schemes for differencing the hydrodynamic equations. We have regarded the nature of the grid upon which such differencing schemes are applied as an independent issue outside the scope of this work. Therefore we have restricted our study to the case of uniform, square computational zones in Cartesian coordinates. For simplicity we have further restricted our attention to two-dimensional difference schemes which are built out of symmetrized products of one-dimensional difference operators. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

For a compressible fluid there are no simple solutions corresponding to certain other flows (such as the Poiseuille flow between fixed parallel flat plates) described by simple solutions for an incompressible fluid. A solution is found for the flow of a gas over an infinite porous plate with uniform suction through the plate (gravity neglected), and the relation of the solution to asymptotic solutions of the boundary-layer equations is discussed. Ordinary differential equations are obtained for the problems of (i) the flow due to the rotation of a horizontal disk in a gas (dissipation neglected), and (ii) the steady circulatory flow round a porous circular cylinder with uniform suction (gravity neglected). Discussion of the gas-dynamical problems is preceded by a description of the state of a horizontally stratified gas in static and thermal equilibrium.},

abstract = {In this article, a conservative least-squares polynomial reconstruction operator is applied to the discontinuous Galerkin method. In a first instance, piecewise polynomials of degree N are used as test functions as well as to represent the data in each element at the beginning of a time step. The time evolution of these data and the flux computation, however, are then done with a different set of piecewise polynomials of degree M ≥ N, which are reconstructed from the underlying polynomials of degree N. This approach yields a general, unified framework that contains as two special cases classical high order finite volume (FV) schemes (N = 0) as well as the usual discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method (N = M). In the first case, the polynomial is reconstructed from cell averages, for the latter, the reconstruction reduces to the identity operator. A completely new class of numerical schemes is generated by choosing N ≠ 0 and M {\textgreater} N. The reconstruction operator is implemented for arbitrary polynomial degrees N and M on unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes in two and three space dimensions. To provide a high order accurate one-step time integration of the same formal order of accuracy as the spatial discretization operator, the (reconstructed) polynomial data of degree M are evolved in time locally inside each element using a new local continuous space-time Galerkin method. As a result of this approach, we obtain, as a high order accurate predictor, space-time polynomials for the vector of conserved variables and for the physical fluxes and source terms, which then can be used in a natural way to construct very efficient fully-discrete and quadrature-free one-step schemes. This feature is particularly important for DG schemes in three space dimensions, where the cost of numerical quadrature may become prohibitively expensive for very high orders of accuracy. Numerical convergence studies of all members of the new general class of proposed schemes are shown up to sixth-order of accuracy in space and time on unstructured two- and three-dimensional meshes for two very prominent nonlinear hyperbolic systems, namely for the Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics and the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The results indicate that the new class of intermediate schemes (N ≠ 0, M {\textgreater} N) is computationally more efficient than classical finite volume or DG schemes. Finally, a large set of interesting test cases is solved on unstructured meshes, where the proposed new time stepping approach is applied to the equations of ideal and relativistic MHD as well as to nonlinear elasticity, using a standard high order WENO finite volume discretization in space to cope with discontinuous solutions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Fries2015,
abstract = {Fuel injection as well as digital switching strategies in fluid power applications are not only famous representatives of a large field of technology but also a main reason for the increasing interest in wave propagation effects in research. While there is a huge number of works dealing with the pressure drop of different hydraulic components in the steady state, many issues still remain unresolved in the transient regime, even in the case of laminar fluid flow. A better understanding of these processes would be a great benefit as it would lead to a higher accuracy of predicted system responses. In order to reach a higher degree of precision, the highly sophisticated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes are a wide-spread tool. These codes solve the famous Navier-Stokes equations in all three dimensions of space and therefore result in the full resolution of the pressure field as well as of the velocity field. A very awkward topic of performing a CFD simulation is the choice of the boundary condition, which should correspond to a physical one. At the latest when measurements for validation are carried out, the boundary condition of the experimental setup should match the one used in the simulation. Especially the use of a volumetric flow rate boundary condition is fraught with problems. Using a moving piston, a definite volumetric flow rate could be forced on a boundary. In an experimental setup only the measurement of the position of the piston would be necessary to use it in the simulation. This measurement has no backlash on the system, which is therefore well separated. In this work a moving piston boundary condition including gap flow is implemented and used in OpenFOAM. For this reason moving walls have to be used and the mesh has to change during the simulation. Results of simulations done with this moving piston boundary condition are compared with simulations done with an ordinary volumetric boundary condition.},

Using the time history of an earthquake excitation, the results of the FSI model are compared with those obtained employing simplified mechanical models given in design codes.

In particular, we discuss how to build this software tool for the case of fluid-structure interaction problem, from finite element code FEAP for structural and finite volume code OpenFOAM for fluid mechanics. This is achieved by using the Component Template Library (CTL) to provide the coupling between the existing codes into a single software product. The present CTL code-coupling procedure accepts not only different discretization schemes, but different languages, with the solid component written in Fortran and fluid component written in C++ . Moreover, the resulting CTL-based code also accepts the nested parallelization. The proposed coupling strategy is detailed for explicit and implicit fixed-point iteration solver presented in the Part I of this paper, referred to Direct Force-Motion Transfer/Block- Gauss-Seidel. However, the proposed code-coupling framework can easily accommodate other solution schemes. The selected application examples are chosen to confirm the capability of the code-coupling strategy to provide a quick development of advanced computational tools for demanding practical problems, such as 3D fluid models with free-surface flows interacting with structures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

(2015a) and Bonet et al. (2015b). The paper shows how the tensor cross product facilitates the algebra associated with the area and volume maps between reference and final configurations. These maps, together with the fibre map, make up the fundamental kinematic variables in polyconvex elasticity. The algebra proposed leads to novel expressions for the tangent elastic operator which neatly separates material from geometrical dependencies. The paper derives new formulas for the spatial and material stress and their corresponding elasticity tensors. These are applied to the simple case of a Mooney-Rivlin material model. The extension to transversely isotropic material models is also considered.},

abstract = {A novel computational methodology is presented for the numerical analysis of fast transient dynamics phenomena in large deformations. The new mixed formulation can be written in the form of a system of first order conservation laws, where the linear momentum, the deformation gradient tensor and the total energy of the system are used as main conservation variables, leading to identical convergence patterns for both displacements and stresses. A cell centred Finite Volume Method is utilised to carry out the spatial discretisation. Naturally, discontinuity of the conservation variables across control volume interfaces leads to a Riemann problem, whose approximate solution is derived. A suitable numerical interface flux is evaluated by means of the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions. We take advantage of the conservative formulation to introduce a Total Variation Diminishing shock capturing technique to improve dramatically the performance of the algorithm in the vicinity of sharp solution gradients. A series of numerical examples will be presented in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the scheme. The new formulation is proven to be very efficient in nearly incompressible and bending dominated scenarios in comparison with classical finite element displacement-based approaches. The proposed numerical framework provides a good balance between accuracy and speed of computation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Efficient solution techniques for high-order accurate time-dependent problems are investigated for solving the two-dimensional non-linear Euler equations in this work. The spatial discretization consists of a high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approach. Implicit time-integration techniques are considered exclusively in order to avoid the stability restrictions of explicit methods. Standard backwards differencing methods (BDF1 and BDF2) as well as a second-order Crank-Nicholson (CN2) and a fourth-order implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK4) scheme are considered in an attempt to balance the spatial and temporal accuracy of the overall approach. The implicit system arising at each time step is solved using a p-multigrid approach, which is shown to produce h independent convergence rates, while remaining relatively insensitive to the time-step size. The Crank-Nicholson methodology, although not L-stable, demonstrates superior performance compared to the BDF2 scheme for the problems chosen in this work. However, the fourth-order accurate implicit Runge-Kutta scheme is found to be the most efficient in terms of computational cost for a given accuracy level as compared to the lower-order schemes, in spite of the added cost per time step, and the benefits of this scheme increase for tighter error tolerances. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Even for conditions representative of routine laboratory conditions and military ballistics, dramatic differences are seen between the exact and approximate Riemann solution. The greatest discrepancy arises from misallocation of energy between compressional and thermal modes by the approximate solver, resulting in nonphysical entropy and temperature estimates. Several pathological conditions arise in common practice and modifications to the method to handle these are discussed. These include points where genuine nonlinearity is lost, degeneracies, and eigenvector deficiencies that occur upon melting. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We introduce new Godunov-type semidiscrete central schemes for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws and Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The schemes are based on the use of more precise information about the local speeds of propagation and can be viewed as a generalization of the schemes from [A. Kurganov and E. Tadmor, A. Kurganov and G. Petrova, A third-order semidiscrete genuinely multidimensional central scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws and related problems, Numer. Math., to appear] and [A. Kurganov and E. Tadmor, J. Comput. Phys., 160 (2000), pp. 720-742]. The main advantages of the proposed central schemes are the high resolution, due to the smaller amount of the numerical dissipation, and the simplicity. There are no Riemann solvers and characteristic decomposition involved, and this makes them a universal tool for a wide variety of applications. At the same time, the developed schemes have an upwind nature, since they respect the directions of wave propagation by measuring the one-sided local speeds. This is why we call them central-upwind schemes. The constructed schemes are applied to various problems, such as the Euler equations of gas dynamics, the Hamilton-Jacobi equations with convex and nonconvex Hamiltonians, and the incom-pressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. The incompressibility condition in the latter equations allows us to treat them both in their conservative and transport form. We apply to these problems the central-upwind schemes, developed separately for each of them, and compute the corresponding numerical solutions.},

@book{Martijn2010,
abstract = {Both biological and engineering scientists have always been intrigued by the flight of insects and birds. For a long time, the aerodynamic mechanism behind flap- ping insect flight was a complete mystery, until several decades ago. Experiments showed the presence of a vortex on top of the flapping wings, generates forces larger than obtained by using conventional aircraft aerodynamics. Flapping wings produce both lifting and propulsive forces such that it becomes possible for insects and smaller bird species, e.g. hummingbirds, to stay aloft and hover, but also to perform extreme manoeuvres. Because of this versatility, insects and smaller birds are an inspiration for the development of flapping wing Micro Air Vehicles, small man-made flyer's to use in exploration and surveillance. Several flow visualisation experiments and numerical simulations have been performed to improve the understanding of flapping wing aerodynamics in order to design and optimise Micro Air Vehicles. However, the effects of wing kinemat- ics on the flow and forces is still not fully understood. We performed two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations in order to systematically vary relevant parameters, related to the wing motion and flow physics. In order to capture the boundary layer and the near wake, it is important to maintain a high mesh quality near the moving wing, especially at large rotations. Therefore, an accurate mesh motion technique is necessary, which is able to cope with large mesh deformations. In order to incorporate a flapping wing in our numerical model, different mesh mo- tion techniques are compared and improved. The overall goal of this part of the research is to develop a reliable mesh deformation technique, in terms of accuracy and efficiency, to solve the flow around flapping wings. The flow around flapping wings, at the scale relevant to insect flight, is highly unsteady and vortical, described by the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Different dimensionless numbers are discussed, characterising the flow, i.e. Strouhal and Reynolds numbers. Since the flow at the considered Reynolds number, Re = O(100), is laminar, there is no need for additional turbulence modelling, such that our simulations, assuming laminar flow, may be treated as a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). In order to solve the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, the com- mercial software Fluent and the open-source code OpenFOAM have been used extensively. Different mesh motion solvers are compared. Two existing methods are assessed, solving the Laplace and a modified stress equation. Both methods are very efficient by using iterative solver techniques. However, these mesh motion solvers are not able to maintain high mesh quality at large rotation angles, which occur in insect flight. Therefore, a new mesh motion solver is implemented, which is based on the interpolation of radial basis functions. This mesh motion solver is a point based method, which means that the dis- placement of all individual internal mesh points are evaluated, based on a given boundary displacement, and updated accordingly. No mesh connectivity informa- tion is necessary, so that it can be applied to unstructured polyhedral meshes. To increase its efficiency, a coarsening is applied to the set of moving boundary points, such that only selected control points are used. This decreases the size of the system of equations and associated computational effort considerably. After the discussion of the governing equations, finite volume discretisation in OpenFOAM and the assessment of the mesh motion solvers, the physical and numerical modelling are described. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are rewritten in the rotating reference frame in order to identify dimensionless numbers related to the wing motion. The most important number is the Rossby number, which represents the wing stroke path curvature.},

Nowadays computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides the state-of-the-art capabilities of simulating the hydrodynamics in these reactors. In the present work, bubble column is numerically simulated by using open source CFD tool, OpenFOAM 2.3.1. Euler-Euler two-fluid model is used for the simulations. In the first part, OpenFOAM simulations are validated with experimental data from the literature over a column diameter range of 138–600 mm and the superficial gas velocity in the range of 19–169 mm/s. The velocity and holdup patterns as well as circulation patterns in the bubble column are compared. In addition, Fluent{\textregistered} simulations are performed for the same conditions in order to compare the accuracy of OpenFOAM solvers. In the second part of the work, the validated OpenFOAM solver is applied to simulate the flow field in the 120 mm ID bubble column with and without internals. The internals consisted of (a) one vertical central rod of 36 mm diameter, (b) one central rod of (a) and four vertical additional rods of 12 mm diameter, (c) one central rod of (a) and fourteen vertical additional rods of 12 mm diameter. The OpenFOAM simulations are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data for both bubble columns with and without internals.

abstract = {In previous work (Lee et al., 2016, 2017), Lee et al. introduced a new Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) computational framework for large strain explicit solid dynamics with special emphasis on the treatment of near incompressibility. A first order system of hyperbolic equations was presented expressed in terms of the linear momentum and the minors of the deformation, namely the deformation gradient, its co-factor and its Jacobian. Taking advantage of this representation, the suppression of numerical deficiencies (e.g. spurious pressure, long term instability and/or consistency issues) was addressed through well-established stabilisation procedures. In Lee et al. (2016), the adaptation of the very efficient Jameson–Schmidt–Turkel algorithm was presented. Lee et al. (2017) introduced an adapted variationally consistent Streamline Upwind Petrov–Galerkin methodology. In this paper, we now introduce a third alternative stabilisation strategy, extremely competitive, and which does not require the selection of any user-defined artificial stabilisation parameter. Specifically, a characteristic-based Riemann solver in conjunction with a linear reconstruction procedure is used, with the aim to guarantee both consistency and conservation of the overall algorithm. We show that the proposed SPH formulation is very similar in nature to that of the upwind vertex centred Finite Volume Method presented in Aguirre et al. (2015). In order to extend the application range towards the incompressibility limit, an artificial compressibility algorithm is also developed. Finally, an extensive set of challenging numerical examples is analysed. The new SPH algorithm shows excellent behaviour in compressible, nearly incompressible and truly incompressible scenarios, yielding second order of convergence for velocities, deviatoric and volumetric components of the stress.},

abstract = {A series of numerical simulations were performed to explore the influences of filling level, excitation frequency and amplitude on liquid sloshing by using the open source Computational Fluid Dynamics toolbox OpenFOAM (Open Field Operation and Manipulation), which was fully validated by the experimental data. The results show that the dynamic impact pressure is proportional to the external excitation amplitude only in non-resonance frequency ranges. Pressure-frequency response curves demonstrate a transition process from a 'soft-spring' response to a 'hard-spring' response following the changes of the filling level. Such a transition process is found to be dominated by the ratio of the filling level to tank length and the critical value can be obtained. It is also found that wave breaking influences the period of sloshing wave in tanks and ultimately alters the resonance frequency from the linear theory.},

It also discusses recent advances in the computational algorithms associated with this approach for modeling nonlinear fluid/structure interaction problems. These include CFD schemes that are formally second-order time-accurate on moving grids, energy-transfer–conserving methods for discretizing transmission conditions across nonmatching fluid and structure discrete interfaces, and state-of-the-art loosely coupled algorithms for solving efficiently coupled systems of fluid and structural equations arising from the discretization of real aircraft configurations. A taste of the capabilities of such algorithms is provided by reporting on their validation for an F-16 fighter aircraft configuration in various subsonic, transonic, and supersonic airstreams, and at various load factors. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the feasibility and merit of the overviewed computational technology for accurately extracting the flutter envelopes of civilian and military aircraft, and a perspective on future research in CFD-based nonlinear computational aeroelasticity.},

abstract = {A novel computational methodology is presented for the numerical analysis of fast transient dynamics phenomena in large deformations. The new mixed formulation can be written in the form of a system of first order conservation laws, where the linear momentum, the deformation gradient tensor and the total energy of the system are used as main conservation variables, leading to identical convergence patterns for both displacements and stresses. A cell centred Finite Volume Method is utilised to carry out the spatial discretisation. Naturally, discontinuity of the conservation variables across control volume interfaces leads to a Riemann problem, whose approximate solution is derived. A suitable numerical interface flux is evaluated by means of the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions. We take advantage of the conservative formulation to introduce a Total Variation Diminishing shock capturing technique to improve dramatically the performance of the algorithm in the vicinity of sharp solution gradients. A series of numerical examples will be presented in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the scheme. The new formulation is proven to be very efficient in nearly incompressible and bending dominated scenarios in comparison with classical finite element displacement-based approaches. The proposed numerical framework provides a good balance between accuracy and speed of computation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In such cases, the computational mesh needs to adapt to the time-varying shape of the domain and preserve its validity and quality. In this paper, we present a vertex-based unstructured mesh motion solver with the polyhedral cell support which calculates the internal point motion based on the prescribed motion of the boundary. The performance of the method is preserved through the choice of decomposition of polyhedral cells, the bounded discretisation and the use of iterative solvers. A mechanism for minimising mesh distortion through variable stiffness is proposed and tested on a simple deformation case, showing a marked improvement on previous attempts. Finally, the moving mesh solver is used with an unstructured moving mesh FVM algorithm to simulate a free-rising air bubble in water.},

abstract = {The power of OpenFOAM in physical modelling stems from mimicking of partial differential equations in software, thus allowing rapid and reliable implementation of complex physical models. State-of-the art complex geometry handling and dynamic mesh features are essential for practical engineering use. This paper describes features of dynamic mesh support in OpenFOAM. Polyhedral mesh handling implemented in OpenFOAM is a flexible basis for its dynamic mesh features, at several levels. For simple cases of linear deformation or solid body mo- tion, algebraic expressions suffice. For complex cases of time-varying geometry [2] or solution dependent motion, mesh deformation is obtained by solving a mesh motion equa- tion. For extreme deformation, automatic motion is combined with topological changes, where the number or points, faces or cells in the mesh or its connectivity changes dur- ing the simulation. Finally, in cases of extreme and arbitrary mesh motion tetrahedral re-meshing based on edge swapping may be used. Examples of dynamic mesh handling with progressively complex requirements shall be used to show how object-oriented programming simplifies the use of dynamic mesh features with various physics solvers. A self-contained Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) solver in OpenFOAM acts as an illustration of dynamic meshing features and parallelised surface data transfer tools. It combines a second-order Finite Volume fluid flow solver with moving mesh support coupled to a large deformation formulation of the structural mechanics equations in an updated Lagrangian form [3].},

The result is a robust high-order scheme for realistic applications. Convergence studies are presented, verifying design order of accuracy and the superior efficiency of high-order methods for applications dominated by wave propagation. Furthermore, numerical computations of a more complex problem, a vortex-airfoil interaction, show that high-order methods are necessary to capture the significant flow features for transient problems and realistic grid resolutions.

abstract = {Within the group of immersed boundary methods employed for the numerical simulation of fluid-structure interaction problems, the Immersed Structural Potential Method (ISPM) was recently introduced (Gil et al., 2010) [1] in order to overcome some of the shortcomings of existing immersed methodologies. In the ISPM, an incompressible immersed solid is modelled as a deviatoric strain energy functional whose spatial gradient defines a fluid-structure interaction force field in the Navier-Stokes equations used to resolve the underlying incompressible Newtonian viscous fluid. In this paper, two enhancements of the methodology are presented. First, the introduction of a new family of spline-based kernel functions for the transfer of information between both physics. In contrast to classical IBM kernels, these new kernels are shown not to introduce spurious oscillations in the solution. Second, the use of tensorised Gaussian quadrature rules that allow for accurate and efficient numerical integration of the immersed structural potential. A series of numerical examples will be presented in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the enhanced methodology and to draw some key comparisons against other existing immersed methodologies in terms of accuracy, preservation of the incompressibility constraint and computational speed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A study of supersonic air jets has been made by the use of the Mach interferometer. The density distribution in axially symmetric jets with several tank-receiver pressure ratios has been determined, with special emphasis on the 3.7-7 range of ratios. In terms of the dimensionless quantities $\rho$$\rho$0 (ratio of jet density to tank density) and ZD (ratio of distance from orifice to orifice diameter), all jets are closely the same in a region bounded by the orifice and an oblique line from the orifice edge. This line marks an inflection point in the streamlines, and probably indicates the low pressure termination of a three-dimensional Prandtl-Meyer expansion region which reduces the pressure at this point below that of the receiver. The strength of the stationary shock wave in general agrees with that predicted by the Rankine-Hugoniot equations. Recent theoretical computations of the density in the axis of the jets by Owen and Thornhill are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results, but so far no suggestion has appeared for a theory to predict the three-shock configuration in jets. Experiments with two-dimensional jets confined between parallel glass walls demonstrated that the stationary three-shock configuration could not be studied in this way, presumably because of boundary layer effects on the glass which destroy the two-dimensional quality of strong shock waves. {\textcopyright} 1949 The American Physical Society.},

Yet, complex fluids produce much richer physics than classical fluids when they interact with solids, especially at small scales. Here, we couple a nonlinear hyperelastic solid with a single-component two-phase flow, where the fluid can condensate and evaporate naturally due to temperature and/or pressure changes. We propose a fully-coupled fluid–structure interaction algorithm to solve the problem. We illustrate the viability of the theoretical framework and the effectiveness of our algorithms by solving several problems of phase-change-driven implosion, a physical process in which a thin structure collapses due to the condensation of a fluid.},

abstract = {This paper builds on recent work developed by the authors for the numerical analysis of large strain solid dynamics, by introducing an upwind cell centred hexahedral finite volume framework implemented within the open source code OpenFOAM [http://www.openfoam.com/]. In Lee, Gil and Bonet (2013), a first-order hyperbolic system of conservation laws was introduced in terms of the linear momentum and the deformation gradient tensor of the system, leading to excellent behaviour in two-dimensional bending dominated nearly incompressible scenarios. The main aim of this paper is the extension of this algorithm into three dimensions, its tailor-made implementation into OpenFOAM and the enhancement of the formulation with three key novelties. First, the introduction of two different strategies in order to ensure the satisfaction of the underlying involutions of the system, that is, that the deformation gradient tensor must be curl-free throughout the deformation process. Second, the use of a discrete angular momentum projection algorithm and a monolithic Total Variation Diminishing Runge–Kutta time integrator combined in order to guarantee the conservation of angular momentum. Third, and for comparison purposes, an adapted Total Lagrangian version of the hyperelastic-GLACE nodal scheme of Kluth and Despr{\'{e}}s (2010) is presented. A series of challenging numerical examples are examined in order to assess the robustness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm, benchmarking it against an ample spectrum of alternative numerical strategies developed by the authors in recent publications.

@article{Haider2018c,
abstract = {In practical engineering applications involving extremely complex geometries, meshing typically constitutes a large portion of the overall design and analysis time. In the computational mechanics community, the ability to perform calculations on tetrahedral meshes has become increasingly important. For these reasons, automated tetrahedral mesh generation by means of Delaunay and advancing front techniques have recently received increasing attention in a number of applications, namely: crash impact simulations, cardiovascular modelling, blast and fracture modelling. Unfortunately, modern industry codes in solid mechanics typically rely on the use of traditional displacement based Finite Element formulations which possess several distinct disadvantages, namely: (1) reduced order of convergence for strains and stresses in comparison with displacements; (2) high frequency noise in the vicinity of shocks; and (3) numerical instabilities associated with shear locking, volumetric locking and pressure checker-boarding. In order to address the above mentioned shortcomings, a new mixed-based set of equations for solid dynamics formulated in a system of first order hyperbolic conservation laws was introduced. Crucially, the new set of conservation laws has a similar structure to that of the well known Euler equations in the context of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This enables us to borrow some of the available CFD technologies and to adapt the method in the context of solid dynamics. This thesis builds on the work carried out by Lee et al. 2013 by further developing the upwind cell centred finite volume framework for the numerical analysis of large strain explicit solid dynamics and its tailor-made implementation within the open source code OpenFOAM, extensively used in industrial and academic environments. The object oriented nature of OpenFOAM implementation provides a very efficient platform for future development. In this computational framework, the primary unknown variables are linear momentum and deformation gradient tensor of the system. Moreover, the formulation is further extended for an additional set of geometric strain measures comprising of the co-factor of deformation gradient tensor and the Jacobian of deformation, in order to simulate polyconvex constitutive models ensuring material stability. The domain is spatially discretised using a standard Godunov-type cell centred framework where second order accuracy is achieved by employing a linear reconstruction procedure in conjunction with a slope limiter. This leads to discontinuities in variables at the cell interface which motivate the use of a Riemann solver by introducing an upwind bias into the evaluation of numerical contact fluxes. The acoustic Riemann solver presented is further developed by applying preconditioned dissipation to improve its performance in the near incompressibility regime and extending its range to contact applications. Moreover, two evolutionary frameworks are proposed in this study to satisfy the underlying involutions (or compatibility conditions) of the system. Additionally, the spatial discretisation is alternatively represented through a nodal cell centred finite volume framework for comparison purposes. From a temporal discretisation point of view, a two stage Total Variation Diminishing Runge-Kutta time integrator is employed to ensure second order accuracy. Additionally, inclusion of a global posteriori angular momentum projection procedure enables preservation of angular momenta of the system. Finally, benchmark numerical examples are simulated to demonstrate various aspects of the formulation including mesh convergence, momentum preservation and the locking-free nature of the formulation on complex computational domains.},

A partitioned quasi-Newton technique which solves the coupled problem through nonlinear equations corresponding to the interface position is presented and its performance is compared with a monolithic Newton algorithm. Various structural configurations with an incompressible fluid are solved, and the ratio of the time for the partitioned simulation, when convergence is reached, to the time for the monolithic simulation is found to be between 1/2 and 4. However, in this comparison of the partitioned and monolithic simulations, the flow and structural equations have been solved with a direct sparse solver in full Newton-Raphson iterations, only relatively small problems have been solved and this ratio would likely change if large industrial problems were considered or if other solution strategies were used. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

Therefore, it becomes necessary to establish appropriate verifications that can be useful to users going for instance, through the selection of equations discretization schemes from fvSchemes libraries and of solution solvers from fvSolutions libraries, to be later applied in the simulation of a given specific problem. With this purpose, executable solvers available in openFoam 1.7 version to solve supersonic air flow problems are tested. Two different approaches have been taken in developing numerical methods to solve problems in transport phenomena at all Mach numbers and traditionally, they have been referred to as pressure-based and density-based methods.

For the hyperelastostatic case, the appropriate variational setting is defined through the ALE Dirichlet principle. For the corresponding hyperelastodynamic problem, the ALE Hamilton principle introduces the governing equations. A general frame is set up for both, the static and the dynamic case.

abstract = {Currently, the interaction between free surface flow and an elastic structure is simulated with monolithic codes which calculate the deformation of the structure and the liquid-gas flow simultaneously. In this work, this interaction is calculated in a partitioned way with a separate flow solver and a separate structural solver using the interface quasi-Newton algorithm with approximation for the inverse of the Jacobian from a least-squares model (IQN-ILS). The interaction between an elastic beam and a sloshing liquid in a rolling tank is calculated and the results agree well with experimental data. Subsequently, the impact of both a rigid cylinder and a flexible composite cylinder on a water surface is simulated to assess the effect of slamming on the components of certain wave-energy converters. The impact pressure on the bottom of the rigid cylinder is nearly twice as high as on the flexible cylinder, which emphasizes the need for fluid-structure interaction calculations in the design process of these wave-energy converters. For both the rolling tank simulations and the impact simulations, grid refinement is performed and the IQN-ILS algorithm requires the same number of iterations on each grid. The simulations on the coarse grid are also executed using Gauss-Seidel coupling iterations with Aitken relaxation which requires significantly more coupling iterations per time step. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Turek2010,
abstract = {An Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation is applied in a fully coupled monolithic way, considering the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem as one continuum. The mathematical description and the numerical schemes are designed in such a way that general constitutive relations (which are realistic for biomechanics applications) for the fluid as well as for the structural part can be easily incorporated. We utilize the LBB-stable finite element pairs Q 2 P 1 and P 2+ P 1 for discretization in space to gain high accuracy and perform as time-stepping the 2nd order Crank-Nicholson, respectively, a new modified Fractional-Step-$\theta$-scheme for both solid and fluid parts. The resulting discretized nonlinear algebraic system is solved by a Newton method which approximates the Jacobian matrices by a divided differences approach, and the resulting linear systems are solved by direct or iterative solvers, preferably of Krylov-multigrid type. For validation and evaluation of the accuracy and performance of the proposed methodology, we present corresponding results for a new set of FSI benchmark configurations which describe the self-induced elastic deformation of a beam attached to a cylinder in laminar channel flow, allowing stationary as well as periodically oscillating deformations. Then, as an example of FSI in biomedical problems, the influence of endovascular stent implantation on cerebral aneurysm hemodynamics is numerically investigated. The aim is to study the interaction of the elastic walls of the aneurysm with the geometrical shape of the implanted stent structure for prototypical 2D configurations. This study can be seen as a basic step towards the understanding of the resulting complex flow phenomena so that in future aneurysm rupture shall be suppressed by an optimal setting of the implanted stent geometry. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer.},

@article{Slone2003,
abstract = {A procedure for evaluating the dynamic structural response of elastic solid domains is presented. A prerequisite for the analysis of dynamic fluid-structure interaction is the use of a consistent set of finite volume (FV) methods on a single unstructured mesh. This paper describes a three-dimensional (3D) FV, vertex-based method for dynamic solid mechanics. A novel Newmark predictor-corrector implicit scheme was developed to provide time accurate solutions and the scheme was evaluated on a 3D cantilever problem. By employing a small amount of viscous damping, very accurate predictions of the fundamental natural frequency were obtained with respect to both the amplitude and period of oscillation. This scheme has been implemented into the multi-physics modelling software framework, PHYSICA, for later application to full dynamic fluid structure interaction. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

@article{Gaitonde2002,
abstract = {Results are documented of a blind validation study to characterize the accuracy of an upwind-biased finite volume method in predicting the surface loads caused by a laminar viscous/inviscid interaction. The effort supports a recent Research and Technology Organization code validation initiative and considers a benchmark configuration of the Working Group 10, consisting of Mach 9.5 flow past a 25/55 deg sharp-tipped double cone at a Reynolds number of 1.39435 × 106/m. Roe's flux-difference splitting scheme is employed with a nominally third-order reconstruction method and harmonic limiting. An extensive iterative- and grid-convergence study is performed to ensure solution accuracy. Comparison with experimental data shows that overall the numerical method reproduces the features of the interaction, including location and extent of separation to a degree that may be characterized as adequate for engineering purposes. However, upstream of separation and in the narrow peak heating region, discrepancies in heat transfer rates between computation and experiment range between 10 and 15{\%} of maximum values. An exploration of the sensitivity of the solution to small variations (up to 10{\%}) in several flow and numerical parameters reveals only modest influence on the nondimensionalized quantities.},

@article{Haider2018a,
abstract = {The paper presents a new computational framework for the numerical simulation of fast large strain solid dynamics, with particular emphasis on the treatment of near incompressibility. A complete set of first order hyperbolic conservation equations expressed in terms of the linear momentum and the minors of the deformation (namely the deformation gradient, its co-factor and its Jacobian), in conjunction with a polyconvex nearly incompressible constitutive law, is presented. Taking advantage of this elegant formalism, alternative implementations in terms of entropy-conjugate variables are also possible, through suitable symmetrisation of the original system of conservation variables. From the spatial discretisation standpoint, modern Computational Fluid Dynamics code “OpenFOAM” [http://www.openfoam.com/] is here adapted to the field of solid mechanics, with the aim to bridge the gap between computational fluid and solid dynamics. A cell centred finite volume algorithm is employed and suitably adapted. Naturally, discontinuity of the conservation variables across control volume interfaces leads to a Riemann problem, whose resolution requires special attention when attempting to model materials with predominant nearly incompressible behaviour ($\kappa$∕$\mu$≥500). For this reason, an acoustic Riemann solver combined with a preconditioning procedure is introduced. In addition, a global a posteriori angular momentum projection procedure proposed in Haider et al. (2017) is also presented and adapted to a Total Lagrangian version of the nodal scheme of Kluth and Despr{\'{e}}s (2010) used in this paper for comparison purposes. Finally, a series of challenging numerical examples is examined in order to assess the robustness and applicability of the proposed methodology with an eye on large scale simulation in future works.},

@article{Sevilla2017,
abstract = {This paper presents a high-order accurate stabilised finite element formulation for the simulation of transient inviscid flow problems in deformable domains. This work represents an extension of the methodology described in Sevilla et al. (2013), where a high-order stabilised finite element formulation was used as an efficient alternative for the simulation of steady flow problems of aerodynamic interest. The proposed methodology combines the Streamline Upwind/Petrov-Galerkin method with the generalised-$\alpha$ method and employs an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) description to account for the motion of the underlying mesh. Two computational frameworks, based on the use of reference and spatial variables are presented, discussed and thoroughly compared. In the process, a tailor-made discrete geometric conservation law is derived in order to ensure that a uniform flow field is exactly reproduced. Several numerical examples are presented in order to illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology. The results demonstrate the optimal approximation properties of both spatial and temporal discretisations as well as the crucial benefits, in terms of accuracy, of the exact satisfaction of the discrete geometric conservation law. In addition, the behaviour of the proposed high-order formulation is analysed in terms of the chosen stabilisation parameter. Finally, the benefits of using high-order approximations for the simulation of inviscid flows in moving domains are discussed by comparing low and high-order approximations for the solution of the Euler equations on a deformable domain.},

@article{Persson2009a,
abstract = {We describe a method for computing time-dependent solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations on variable geometries. We introduce a continuous mapping between a fixed reference configuration and the time-varying domain. By writing the Navier-Stokes equations as a conservation law for the independent variables in the reference configuration, the complexity introduced by variable geometry is reduced to solving a transformed conservation law in a fixed reference configuration. The spatial discretization is carried out using the Discontinuous Galerkin method on unstructured meshes of triangles, while the time integration is performed using an explicit Runge-Kutta method. For general domain changes, the standard scheme fails to preserve exactly the free-stream solution which leads to some accuracy degradation, especially for low order approximations. This situation is remedied by adding an additional equation for the time evolution of the transformation Jacobian to the original conservation law and correcting for the accumulated metric integration errors. A number of results are shown to illustrate the flexibility of the approach to handle high-order approximations on complex geometries. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
